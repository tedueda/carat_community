# Backend API URL
# Development: Use localhost or leave empty (Vite proxy will handle it)
# Production: Set this in Netlify Dashboard, NOT in .env.production file
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# IMPORTANT: Never commit production URLs to the repository!
# For Netlify deployment, configure VITE_API_URL in:
# Netlify Dashboard > Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment > Environment variables
